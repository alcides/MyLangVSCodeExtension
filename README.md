# MyLang VS Code

This is a vscode (Visual Studio Code) extension to give errors and autocomplete to a small example language.

It is made of two parts, a [language server](./server/README.md) that can be used standalone and a vscode extension that should also works with [Theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia).

This is the result of deleting much of the code of the [ZC buildout LSP extension](https://github.com/perrinjerome/vscode-zc-buildout/).
